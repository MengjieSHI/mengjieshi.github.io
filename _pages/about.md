<p style="font-size: 16px;">
I am a postdoc/research associate at Imperial College London [ULIS](https://ulislab.com/) group. My research focuses on ultrasound blood flow imaging in human brain. 

I did my PhD in biophotonics at King's College London [PURL](https://www.purlkcl.org/) group. I developed image enhancement and quantification algorithms to improve LED-based photoacoustic imaging, aiming to make this technique more practical and reliable for biomedical applications 🦾 

Broadly, I’m fascinated by how we can use light, sound, and intelligent computation to explore the human body in new ways 👩🏻‍🔬
