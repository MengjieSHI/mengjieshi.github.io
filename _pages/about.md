<p style="font-size:16px;">
I am a postdoc/research associate at Imperial College London, <a href="[https://ulislab.com/]" target="_blank">ULIS</a> group. My research focuses on ultrasound blood flow imaging in human brain.

<p style="font-size:16px;">
I did my PhD in biophotonics at King's College London [PURL](https://www.purlkcl.org/) group. I developed image enhancement and quantification algorithms to improve LED-based photoacoustic imaging, aiming to make this technique more practical and reliable for biomedical applications.

Broadly, I’m fascinated by how we can use light, sound, and intelligent computation to explore the human body in new ways.
