Currently I am a postdoc/Research Associate at [ULIS](https://ulislab.com/), Imperial College London supervised by Prof. Mengxing Tang. My research focuses on ultrasound blood flow imaging in human brain 🧐 .

I finished my PhD in Oct 2024 at [PURL](https://www.purlkcl.org/), King's College London supervised by Dr. Wenfeng Xia. During my PhD, I developed image enhancement and quantification algorithms to improve LED-based photoacoustic imaging, aiming to make this technique more practical and reliable for biomedical applications 🦾 .

Broadly, I’m fascinated by how we can use light, sound, and intelligent computation to explore the human body in new ways 👩🏻‍🔬 .
