Last-year PhD student at [PURL](https://www.purlkcl.org/), supervised by Dr. [Wenfeng Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bLvnwOAAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Tom Vercauteren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zduEJkcAAAAJ&hl=en), Department of Biomedical Enigneering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London, UK. 

My research focuses on developing learning-based methods to tackle inverse problems in photoacoustic tomography. I also work on enhancing photoacoustic imaging for minimally invasive procedures, which includes visual enhancement and automatic tracking of surgical tools such as needles.

I update my publications at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mengjie-Shi-4)

My research interest: biophotonics, ultrasound, signal and imaging processing, machine/deep learning.
