<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:16px;">
I am a postdoc/research associate at Imperial College London, <a href="[https://ulislab.com/]" target="_blank">ULIS</a> group. My research focuses on ultrasound blood flow imaging in human brain.

I did my PhD in biophotonics at King's College London, <a href="[https://ulislab.com/]" target="_blank">PURL</a> group. I developed image enhancement and quantification algorithms to improve LED-based photoacoustic imaging, aiming to make this technique more practical and reliable for biomedical applications.

Broadly, I’m fascinated by how we can use <b>light</b>, <b>sound</b>, and <b>intelligent computation</b> to explore the human body in new ways.
