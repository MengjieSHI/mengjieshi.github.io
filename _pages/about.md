Currently I am a postdoc/Research Associate at [ULIS](https://ulislab.com/), Imperial College London supervised by Prof. Mengxing Tang. My research focuses on ultrasound blood flow imaging in human brain.

I finished my PhD in Oct 2024 at [PURL](https://www.purlkcl.org/), King's College London supervised by Dr. Wenfeng Xia. My PhD thesis is about developing image enhancement and quantification algorithms for LED-based photoacoustic imaging. 

I updated my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=tMoMEjoAAAAJ)

My research interest: biophotonics, ultrasound, medical signal and imaging processing, machine/deep learning.  

In my spare time, I am practicing tennis, cooking food, hiking, writing, and photographing.
